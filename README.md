Imdone Obsidian Plugin
====

[Imdone](https://imdone.io) is a simple and powerful kanban board that works on top of a local folder of plain text markdown files or code.

This plugin will turn all your imdone cards into imdone links in obsidian. Clicking on a link will open imdone to the card.

Imdone will open obsidian to the card source in edit mode if **Open obsidian at card source line** is switched on in your board settings.

Works with imdone 1.50.0 and later.
